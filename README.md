## Project Description & Why This Project &#x1F4D3;

One of the oldest and most enduring mediums of exchange, even predating the Neolithic period (~10,000–3,000 BCE), was physical assets or tangible goods; whether that be livestock, consumables such as wheat or barley, or even salt or other precious refined minerals.

With the global population growing at an average CAGR of 1.89%, the challenge of sustainable food production on a global scale has become more critical than ever. Rising global food prices exacerbate food insecurity and poverty; a situation worsened by geopolitical conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war and the lingering effects of COVID-19-related labor shortages. These spikes in global food prices or the raw inputs that go into creating consumable food products have not only been seen numerous times throughout history but stress the importance of nations effectively acquiring agricultural commodities (Maize, Wheat, Barley, Refined Sugar, etc.) to effectively feed mass populations.

Not only is this topic crucial the longevity of the human race - but commodities (agriculture, soft commodities, or other commodities), more specifically, alternative assets (to that of which commodities fall into) are becoming more and more prominent in financial markets. As equity, fixed income, or other traditional asset classes become oversaturated, alternative asset classes (to that of which commodities fall into) and derivatives pertaining, although often much more volatile than traditional assets have grown immensely popular to hedge or bolster portfolios and returns/ alpha.

With this personal and professional appreciation for commodities, particularly agricultural commodities in mind, I hope to explore the five following research questions throughout this article:

1. What key insights regarding global agricultural trade relationships can be derived through preliminary EDA?

2. What does global agricultural trade look like between and among G7 and BRICS nations?

3. How has the USD/ Tonne fluctuated from 2000 to 2022 for the three agricultural commodities with the highest import trade volumes, and is there any relationship between these price changes and the VIX?

4. Using PCA and KMeans Clustering, what are the key traits that characterize the top three agricultural commodities, defined by the highest trade volumes, between 2000 and 2022?

5. Earth’s most valuable crop: How can US agricultural purchasers leverage opportunity cost methodology to identify arbitrage opportunities in the global trade of corn (maize) by analyzing the largest exporters and importers among G7 and BRICS nations?
